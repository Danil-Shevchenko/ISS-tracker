# React + Vite + Google Maps

This project is a test assignment built with React and Vite, using the Google Maps API via the `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` library.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
````

### 2. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your own Google Maps API key:

```
VITE_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
```

🔐 **Important:** The `VITE_` prefix is required for Vite to expose the variable to your React app.

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```
